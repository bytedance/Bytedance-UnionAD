**Notice:**
1. **Upgrade cannot be clicked when the current version is the latest version**, when the version is lower than the latest online version, you can use Upgrade to perform the version upgrade import operation, see the screenshot for details![import.png](https://sf-tb-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ad-penny-oversea-bucket/7dbf3d6405c44ea0a613e6652bee0c23)
2. In addition, the Pangle Unity Adapter plugin no longer provides the dual-end PangleSDK resource package after version 3700, that is, the original [Example.unitypackage, PangleAdapterScripts.unitypackage, PangleSDK.unitypackage] becomes [Example.unitypackage, PangleAdapterScripts.unitypackage], Among them, Example.unitypackage is still our example Demo code, and PangleAdapterScripts.unitypackage is still our Adapter Plugin.
3. We will pull online resources (Android from maven, iOS from Pod) when Unity exports the native project. Therefore, if you have not installed the Pod tool locally, you should first [install Pod](https://guides. cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
4. **[Strongly recommended]** After the SDK version is automatically upgraded, you need to find Link Binary With Libraries in TARGETS -> Unity- iPhone in the exported xcode project, and click "+" to add UnityFramework.framework![iOS自动升级补充.png](https://sf-tb-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ad-penny-oversea-bucket/e0f77e26b46c40d2bccc696c8849a427)
